    <p></p> <b>Description</b>


<p>Part of what it is to be scientifically-literate, it's not simply,
  'Do you know what DNA is? Or what the Big Bang is?' That's an aspect
   of science literacy. The biggest part of it is do you know how to think
    about information that's presented in front of you.</p>

<p>There's a lot to do in space. I want to learn more about the greenhouse
   effect on Venus, about whether there was life on Mars, about the environment
    in which Earth and the Sun is immersed, the behavior of the Sun.</p>

<p>If God is the mystery of the universe, these mysteries, we're tackling these
   mysteries one by one. If you're going to stay religious at the end of the
   conversation, God has to mean more to you than just where science has yet to tread.</p>

<p>I've spent quality time in the aerospace community, with my service on two
   presidential commissions, but at heart, I'm an academic. Being an academic
   means I don't wield power over person, place or thing. I don't command armies;
   I don't lead labor unions. All I have is the power of thought.</p>
